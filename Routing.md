1.Main concepts:
A.React Router isn't just about matching a url to a function or component: it's about building a full user interface that maps to the URL, so it might have more concepts in it than you're used to. We'll go into detail on the three main jobs of React Router:

   1.Subscribing and manipulating the history stack
   2.Matching the URL to your routes
   3.Rendering a nested UI from the route matches


a.History object in react routing:
A.Apps don't need to set up their own history objects--that's the job of <Router>. It sets up one of these objects, subscribe to changes in the history stack, and finally updates its state when the URL changes. This causes the app to re-render and the correct UI to display. The only thing it needs to put on state is a location, everything else works from that single object.

b.Locations in react routing:
A.  1.The browser has a location object on window.location. It tells   you information about the URL but also has some methods to change it:
  window.location.pathname; // /getting-started/concepts/
  window.location.hash; // #location
  window.location.reload(); // force a refresh w/ the server
  // and a lot more


2.Instead of using window.location, React Router has the concept of a location that's patterned after window.location but is much simpler. It looks like this:
  {
  pathname: "/bbq/pig-pickins",
  search: "?campaign=instagram",
  hash: "#menu",
  state: null,
  key: "aefz24ie"
  }

  The first 3 are js specific and last 2 are react specific.

 3.The difference between the Link component in React Router and the href attribute in HTML lies in their functionality and purpose within web applications.
A.React Router's Link Component:
The Link component is part of React Router, which is a library for handling routing in React applications.
It is used to navigate between different views or pages within a single-page application (SPA) without causing a full page reload.
When a Link component is clicked, React Router intercepts the event and updates the browser's URL without reloading the entire page. It then renders the corresponding component associated with the new URL.
The Link component is typically used with React Router's <BrowserRouter> or <HashRouter> to manage the application's routing.

   import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

   <Link to="/about">About</Link>

   HTML's href Attribute:
    1.The href attribute is a standard attribute in HTML that is used to specify the URL of a hyperlink or the location of a linked resource.
    2.When an anchor (<a>) element with an href attribute is clicked, the browser typically navigates to the specified URL, causing a full page reload.
    3.In traditional multi-page web applications, the href attribute is commonly used to link to different pages or external resources.

  <a href="/about">About</a>

    In summary, the main difference between Link in React Router and href in HTML is that Link is specifically designed for client-side navigation within React applications, providing a seamless and faster user experience in single-page applications, while href in HTML is a standard attribute used for navigation in traditional multi-page applications, causing full page reloads.
